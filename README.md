This repository contains source code for the PEARS student metrics analysis platform. This streamlit app enables analysis of student academic and pastoral performance over time for specific students within a cohort. The app provides a template data entry document and example data, which can be used to test the summary statistics and data visualisation capabilities with respect to student task performance and wellbeing data.
